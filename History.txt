=== 1.1.2

* Warnings can be disabled using --no-warnings.

* Fixed not .exe being generated when script calls 'exit'.

* Path to the generated executable is now avilable to the running
  script in the OCRA_EXECUTABLE environment variable.

* Directories on the command line will now be created.

* Supports path globs, fx. "ocra script.rb assets/**/*.png". (See
  documentation for Ruby's Dir class).

* Fixed issue with spaces in temporary path (TMP environment).

* Improved path comparison to ignore case (this is Windows after all)
  and be a bit more robust.

* Added support for RubyGems installed in GEM_HOME (or other part
  handled by RubyGems). If not installed in the Ruby hierarchy, they
  will now be installed in a directory named 'gemhome' under the
  temporary directory.

=== 1.1.1

* Fixed duplicate entries in the RUBYLIB environment variable.

* Another slight fix for relative load paths.

* RUBYOPT is now set to the value it had when OCRA was invoked.

=== 1.1.0

* Added an icon to the executable. Can be replaced from a .ico file
  using the --icon <ico> option.

* Improved handling of load paths added either from the command line
  (ruby -I), RUBYLIB environment variable or during the script (by
  modifying $: or $LOAD_PATH).

* Now automatically detects loaded DLLs through Win32::API. Disable
  with --no-autodll.

=== 1.0.1 / 2009-05-05

  (e.g. wxRuby) and fixed issue where OCRA would use ruby.exe instead
